Some notes:

1. Tapping on the screen after the red clear color comes up results in conrod
   rendering just fine - No more "less than 3 vertices" error or anything.

2. conrod appears to not be responding to Touch events - tapping buttons does
   nothing.

3. More related to glutin or android_glue, but putting two fingers on the screen
   results in something interesting. Moving the second finger generates a Moved
   event for the first finger, resulting in a Moved event where the old and new
   coordinates are exactly the same.

4. Everything is small on Android. See

5. The error is caused in conrod/src/backend/glium.rs. Go to that file and find
   the comment beginning with CONROD_TEST for information.

6. The reason the error at CONROD_TEST happens happens because renderer.fill()
   for some reason gets filled with nothing the first time through. There should
   probably be something that doesn't put a draw command in renderer.fill() if
   there are 0 vertices. Doing that will stop the error from coming up, but
   another fix is needed to fix the fact that nothing shows up until you tap the
   screen.
