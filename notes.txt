Some notes:

1. Tapping on the screen after the red clear color comes up results in conrod
   rendering just fine - No more "less than 3 vertices" error or anything.

2. conrod appears to not be responding to Touch events - tapping buttons does
   nothing.

3. More related to glutin or android_glue, but putting two fingers on the screen
   results in something interesting. Moving the second finger generates a Moved
   event for the first finger, resulting in a Moved event where the old and new
   coordinates are exactly the same.
